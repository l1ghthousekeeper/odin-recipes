Project 1 solution in the course "The Odin Project"

This website proves to the world that I can create basic unstyled static HTML and use github.

Its key differentiator - the "secret sauce", if you will - is that it was crafted by someone with 14 years' experience in the cybersecurity industry. So obviously, it's intrinsically way better than any of my peers' submissions, if you're a chump for marketing. Otherwise it's nothing special.
